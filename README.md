## Technology

Technology Salesman Toolkit is a native iOS application that supports iPhones and iPads with iOS 9 or higher. It was created in Xcode 10.1 with Swift 4.2.1. The architecture used to create TEST is MVC. The app uses a Firebase backend and it uses a local Realm database for caching. Most of my Swift knowledge comes from the book 'App Development with Swift'.

## Testaccount

I've provided an account people can use for testing purposes, but don't hesitate to create your own account! You can create an account with an email/password combination or by signing in with your Google account. You do, however, need to verify your email address if you create your account with the email/password combination.

## Documentation

The entire application has been provided with documentation. I've added documentation for almost every function and property used. Jazzy has been used to create a handy "manual" of the application. The documentation files can be found [here](https://github.com/BramDC3/Technology-Salesman-Toolkit-iOS/tree/master/docs).

## Download

Unfortunaly, I'm not enrolled in the Apple Developer Program so I can't publish the app to the App Store. If you want to download the app, you'll need to clone this repository. Don't forget to install the Pod files!
